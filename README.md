# batchy

BATCHY is a very simple bytecode interpreter. This simple and small code can be used for Arduino!

## installation
In the Arduino IDE you have to install the library `ArduinoSTL`

## code implemention

```
#include "path/to/batchy.h
BATCHY batchy(200);
```
then you can use `batchy.runCommand()` for the interpreter.
